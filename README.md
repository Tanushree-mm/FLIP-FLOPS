# FLIP-FLOPS

**OBJECTIVE**

Flip-Flop (D,SR,JK)
● Write Verilog Description.
● Verify functionality using Test-bench.
● Synthesize the design targeting suitable library and by setting area and timing
constraints.
● Verify the functionality using Gate level netlist and compare the results at RTL
and Gate level Netlist.
From the report generated identify Critical path, Maximum delay, Total Number of
cells, Power Required and Total Area required.

**DESCRIPTION**

Latches and flip-flops are the basic elements for storing information. One latch or flip-flop can store one bit of information. The main difference between latches and flip-flops is that for latches, their outputs are constantly affected by their inputs as long as the enable signal is asserted. In other words, when they are enabled, their content changes immediately when their inputs change. Flip-flops, on the other hand, have their content change only either at the rising or falling edge of the enable signal. This enable signal is usually the controlling clock signal. After the rising or falling edge of the clock, the flip-flop content remains constant even if the input
changes. There are basically four main types of latches and flip-flops: SR, D, and JK. The major differences in these flip-flop types are the number of inputs they have and how they change state. For each type, there are also different variations that enhance their operations.
